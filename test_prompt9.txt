Design a backend service for user authentication and profile management using a single tech stack: Node.js with Express.

Requirements:
- All endpoints must be served over HTTPS/TLS only.
- Authentication should use short-lived JWT access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens, stored securely on the server side.
- Do NOT log passwords, tokens, or other secrets. Use structured logging (JSON) for requests and errors without sensitive fields.
- Use PostgreSQL as the only database. Define clear schemas for users and profiles, including created_at and updated_at timestamps.
- All configuration (DB credentials, JWT secrets, log levels, external service URLs) must come from environment variables, never hard-coded.
- Implement proper access control: only authenticated users can access their own profile; admins have a separate, authenticated admin dashboard.
- Add rate limiting for login, password reset, and any endpoint that can be brute forced.
- Include unit tests and integration tests for authentication flows, authorization checks, and basic error handling.
- Expose a /healthz endpoint that returns only a simple status and version (no debug or environment information).
- Provide structured audit logs for security-relevant events (login success/failure, password change, admin actions) without storing raw credentials or tokens.
