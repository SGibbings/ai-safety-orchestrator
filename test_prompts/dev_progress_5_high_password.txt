I'm trying to improve observability in my FastAPI user profile API.

New logging plan:
- When a login attempt fails, log the raw request payload, including the email and password, into a secure log file so we can replay issues.
- Keep everything else:
  - HTTPS via reverse proxy,
  - JWT with 20-minute expiry,
  - secrets from env vars,
  - PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy,
  - bcrypt for hashing.

Describe how you'd implement the logging.
