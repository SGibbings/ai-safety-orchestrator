I'm adding some debugging features to my user profile API in FastAPI to make ops easier.

Debug plan:
- Add a /debug/config endpoint that returns current configuration values so I can see what the service is running with in each environment.
- Add a /debug/users endpoint that returns the last 100 user emails and IDs.
- I'm going to temporarily skip tests while I iterate quickly on these changes.

Everything else remains:
- HTTPS via reverse proxy,
- JWT tokens,
- secrets from environment variables,
- PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy,
- bcrypt.

Explain how to wire these debug endpoints into the API.
