I'm hacking together an internal Node.js Express service behind Nginx. Requirements:

- Let Nginx handle HTTPS. App accepts HTTP but only internally.
- Use bcrypt with default work factor.
- DB URL + JWT secret from env vars.
- /debug/users returns last 20 emails + IDs.
- Basic logging, no raw tokens.
- Use prepared statements or Prisma.

Sketch the structure and call out acceptable shortcuts.
