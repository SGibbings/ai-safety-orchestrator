Build a FastAPI microservice for employee profiles that will run behind our corporate HTTPS reverse proxy.

Requirements:
- All traffic must use HTTPS; no plain HTTP endpoints.
- Load all secrets (DB_URL, JWT access/refresh secrets) strictly from environment variables.
- Store employees in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.
- Hash passwords using bcrypt with a strong cost factor.
- Use Pydantic models for all request and response validation.
- Implement structured logging (request_id, user_id, endpoint, status code).
- Define clear error handling: return well-formed JSON error responses for 4xx and 5xx errors.
- Add unit tests and basic integration tests for login, profile read/update, and error cases.
- Expose only a /health endpoint for liveness checks; do not add any debug endpoints.

Give me a high-level architecture for this service.
