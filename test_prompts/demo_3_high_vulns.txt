Build an admin management API for internal use.

Plan:
- Use a simple Python web framework like FastAPI or Flask.
- During development, allow admin login over HTTP instead of HTTPS for convenience.
- Hardcode an initial admin username and password directly in the config so we can log in quickly.
- Store admin accounts in a local SQLite database for now.
- Add a /debug/config endpoint that returns the current configuration and environment settings for troubleshooting.
- Log each admin login attempt, including the full admin email address.

Describe how you would structure this API and its endpoints.
