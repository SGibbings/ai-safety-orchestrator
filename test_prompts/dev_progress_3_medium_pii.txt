I'm refining the user profile API in FastAPI. It's still only for internal employees and behind HTTPS.

Updated behavior:
- JWT access tokens (20 minutes), secrets from env vars.
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy, bcrypt for passwords.
- When users sign in, I want to log the email address and whether the login succeeded or failed to help debug issues.
- Keep the existing /health endpoint.
- Logging includes method, path, status code, and now the user's email for each login attempt.

Describe how to integrate this logging into the service.
