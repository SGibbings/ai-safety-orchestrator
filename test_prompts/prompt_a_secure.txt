This is a secure, well-specified service.

I'm building a small backend service in Python (FastAPI) for managing user profiles in a multi-tenant SaaS product. I want this to be production-grade from a security standpoint.

Requirements:
- All requests go over HTTPS only; reject any non-HTTPS traffic.
- OAuth2 / OIDC SSO for authentication with short-lived JWTs.
- Secrets (JWT signing keys, DB URL) from environment variables only.
- Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.
- Do not log raw passwords, tokens, or API keys.
- Use parameterized queries or ORM for DB access.
- /health endpoint must not leak anything sensitive.
- Include unit tests for password hashing + token validation.

Describe structure and critical security checks.
