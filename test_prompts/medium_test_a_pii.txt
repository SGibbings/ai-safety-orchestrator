I'm refining the user profile API in FastAPI. It's still only for internal employees and behind HTTPS.

Updated behavior:
- JWT access tokens (20 minutes), secrets from env vars.
- PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy, bcrypt for passwords.
- When users sign in, I want to log the email address and whether the login succeeded or failed.
