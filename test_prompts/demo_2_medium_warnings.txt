Build an internal REST API for managing projects.

Use either Flask, Django, Express, or Laravel – whichever is fastest to get something working.

Database could be PostgreSQL or MongoDB; we'll decide later during implementation.

Authentication will be added later after the main endpoints are in place.

There is no concrete plan yet for automated tests, logging, or detailed error handling in the first version.

Just provide a rough idea of how you might structure the service.
