I'm updating my user profile API in FastAPI. It still runs behind our HTTPS reverse proxy.

Current plan:
- JWT access tokens (20 minutes).
- Secrets come from environment variables.
- Users in PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy.
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
- I'm not going to worry about tests yet; I'll add those later.
- Logging can be minimal for now.

Outline the updated architecture.
