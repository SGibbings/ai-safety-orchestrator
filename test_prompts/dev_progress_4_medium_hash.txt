I'm optimizing the user profile API in FastAPI.

Changes:
- Instead of bcrypt, I want to hash passwords using SHA-256 with a per-user salt to simplify deployment.
- Everything else stays the same:
  - Secrets from env vars,
  - PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy,
  - JWT access tokens with 20-minute expiry,
  - /health endpoint with basic status.

Explain how to implement this change and any tradeoffs.
