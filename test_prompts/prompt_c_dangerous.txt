I'm building a Go service handling file uploads and user accounts:

- Inside-cluster HTTP only, no TLS enforcement.
- Passwords hashed using SHA-256 + salt (not bcrypt/argon2).
- Hardcoded default admin user in config.
- JWT secret may be hardcoded in local config.
- /debug/state returns last 50 uploaded filenames + user IDs.
- File uploads stored on disk.

Describe implementation and highlight risks.
