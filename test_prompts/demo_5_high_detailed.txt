Design a production-ready FastAPI service that handles financial payout workflows for internal corporate use.

Architecture:
- The service runs behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and enforces TLS 1.2+.
- JWT authentication with separate ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET loaded from environment variables.
- PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy with connection pooling (min=5, max=20).
- Pydantic schemas for all request and response validation.
- Full CRUD for payout rules, payout batches, and reconciliation reports.

Security:
- All secrets stored in environment variables.
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with a strong cost factor.
- Sensitive fields (routing number, tax ID, account owner) encrypted at rest with AES-256.
- Strict input validation, including min/max ranges, allowed enums, and regex constraints.
- No raw tokens, passwords, or secrets should ever be logged.

Logging and Monitoring:
- Structured logs including request_id, user_role, payout_id, and action_type.
- Centralized logging with correlation IDs for tracing payout flows end-to-end.
- Prometheus metrics for payout latency, queue depth, and error rates.
- Alerting when error rates or payout latency exceed thresholds.

Testing:
- Unit tests for controllers, services, and models.
- Integration tests for payout batch creation, reconciliation, and failure handling.
- Load tests for high-volume payout submissions and retries.

Operational tools:
- Add a /debug/payout-dump endpoint, restricted to engineering, that returns the full JSON records of the 50 most recent payout attempts, including recipient emails and payout amounts, to assist with troubleshooting payout issues.
