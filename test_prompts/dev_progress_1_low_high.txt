I'm designing the first version of a user profile API using FastAPI for internal employees. It will run behind our corporate HTTPS reverse proxy.

Requirements:
- Use JWT access tokens with 20-minute expiration.
- Load all secrets (JWT signing key, database URL) strictly from environment variables.
- Store users in PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Hash passwords with bcrypt.
- Expose a /health endpoint that only returns status information, no config or secrets.
- Log request method, path, and response status code.
- Add a small test suite that covers login, token verification, and profile retrieval.

Give me a high-level architecture for this service.
