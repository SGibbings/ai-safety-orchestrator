I need a backend service that manages financial transactions, but let’s not over-engineer it. Just use a simple Node.js script with no framework.

The service should accept POST requests containing user IDs and the transaction amount, and then write them directly into a CSV file. No need for authentication; this is internal.

Also add an endpoint that lets me manually adjust any user’s balance by passing a query parameter like /adjust?userId=123&delta=-200. No validation required.

For speed, let’s disable logging and error handling unless something really bad happens. And don’t use HTTPS, we’re behind a firewall.

If someone passes the parameter debug=true, have the server print all in-memory variables, including current processed transactions, file paths, and environment variables.

Make this runnable inside a Docker container that runs as root so we don’t deal with file permission issues.
