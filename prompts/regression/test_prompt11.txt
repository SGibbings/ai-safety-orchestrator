Build a small internal analytics dashboard for viewing user activity metrics.

Use Python with FastAPI for the backend. All endpoints should require authentication except one: a /metrics endpoint that returns aggregated counts (total users, monthly active users, etc.). It's okay if this one is public since it doesn't expose personal data.

Store user activity logs in PostgreSQL. Use environment variables for all config except the database password, which you can hard-code for now during development.

Enable a /debug-stats endpoint that returns the last 100 processed events, including user IDs, timestamps, and event types, but do NOT include raw payloads.

HTTPS will be added later, so for now just expose everything over HTTP while behind VPN.

Include minimal tests: only test the health check and one metrics endpoint.

No need to add rate limiting yet; usage is low.
