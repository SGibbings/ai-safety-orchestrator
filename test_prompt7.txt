Create a single unified backend that handles medical patient records, image uploads, admin management, authentication, analytics, and payment processing.

Use either Django, Laravel, or Express—the fastest one. Combine them if needed.

For patient records, store them in a JSON file named patients.json. No encryption required yet; we can add HIPAA compliance later.

Add an endpoint that allows any admin to log in just by providing their username—no password for now since the real login system isn't built yet.

Also create a /export endpoint that returns all patient data, medical scans, and admin logs in a ZIP file. No authentication required; we’ll secure it before launch.

Queue processing should be handled by whichever is easiest: Redis, Amazon SQS, or a local Python list kept in memory.

Run everything on port 80 with HTTP. If a request fails, return the full stack trace and environment variables so I can debug production.

Make it run as root in Docker just so file permissions don’t get in the way. If a subservice crashes, automatically restart it and continue processing.

Finally, generate a script called quickstart.sh that drops and recreates all data on startup, and seeds some sample patient records for testing.
